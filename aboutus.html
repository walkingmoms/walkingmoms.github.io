    <b>Who are we?</b> <br> </section> 
    Walking Moms is a free group that organizes weekly walks. Meetups are not limited to walking and can include running, working out, bike rides, play dates, mom's night out and other events at leaders discretion.
Anyone is welcome to host walks at any park or trail in your group's area. <br><br>
Each week a leader will post an announcement with upcoming walks. <br><br>
Walking Moms value diversity and recognize the unique gifts of mothers from all walks of life. <br><br>
Our common bond is our motherhood and we strive to cultivate a group that includes the diversity of racial and cultural identity and background, nationality, sexual and affectional orientation, gender identity and its expression, religious background and belief, marital status, family structure, age, mental and physical health and ability, political perspective, and educational and class status. You are welcome here.<br><br> </section>
<section> <section id="aboutus"><b> LIABILITY STATEMENT </b> <br> </section>
Please be aware that all meet ups occur in public locations. We share the trails and parks with members of the general public and expect our members to practice good trail etiquette, be mindful of their surroundings, and to be aware of their own physical capabilities and limits. <br><br></section>
